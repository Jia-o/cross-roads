Model: I used claude pro (!!!)

Strategy: I gave it creative freedom (because I know nothing about crossyroad) and then helped it debug by pasting the relevant lines of code into my prompts. I debugged each existing feature before adding new ones. I tried to prompt the code more than the implication (idk how to phrase this, but I would say "decrease car.speed" instead of "make the cars go slower").

Prompts: docs.google.com/document/d/1hZmkFNeqPArOeCj2Wp_XqdhcN2vRBteQ8qQpdX0y3Rg

Process and Demo:
